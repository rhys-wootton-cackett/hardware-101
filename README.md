# Hardware 101
This hosts the source code for the Hardware 101 website.

## What is this website about?
I intend for this website to not only be used as a way to learn the basic components of hardware that are typically found in a computer, but to allow users to learn more about the hardware that is found inside their own systems.

## Features
- Users can input what hardware is in their PC.
- Users will also be able to login to an account and update the hardware in their PC. 
- They will also be able to access a table of other users' hardware, and will be able to do comparisons and filters on the data.
- There is a page just dedicated to listing the components of a PC, explaining in detail what each of these components do and how they come together to form a whole system.
